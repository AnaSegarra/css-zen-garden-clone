                    <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
                    <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific
                        tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved
                        thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major
                        browser creators.

                        The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
                        lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the
                        time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the
                        web.

                    <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to
                        excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the
                        existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet
                        into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has
                        changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext
                        document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people
                        excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed
                        in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and
                        coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push
                        it further.

                    <p>
                        Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page,
                        so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented
                        well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. Please
                        see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with
                        CSS.

                    <p>
                        You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This
                        may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but
                        follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have
                        completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work)
                        upload your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send us a link to
                        an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use
                        it we will download it and place it on our server.

                        for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all
                        look forward to.
